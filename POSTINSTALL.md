Important Note on User Roles and Privacy:

Admin Creation: The very first account to sign up on Open WebUI will be granted Administrator privileges. This account will have comprehensive control over the platform, including user management and system settings.

User Registrations: All subsequent users signing up will initially have their accounts set to Pending status by default. These accounts will require approval from the Administrator to gain access to the platform functionalities.

The `OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL` variable has to be filled in the `env` file in order for this application to work.
